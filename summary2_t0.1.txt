Almost all waters found in nature acquire ions such as calcium and bicarbonate as they come into contact with rocks and sediments. Biochem Biophys Res Comm 1997: 234 269-74 K. Kikuchi et al: Hydrogen particles and supersaturation in alkaline water from an alkali-ion-water-electrolyzer. Something about Young and his message appealed to her. An extensive list of similarly dubious articles can be found at this huckster site. When that happens, all the benefits, real or mythical disappear. Source : J Toxicol Sci, 1997 May, 22:2, 141-52    Abstract :    Alkaline ionized water (AKW) produced by the electrolysis of tap water (TPW) was given to pregnant rats throughout gestation. This notion is unfounded and was abandoned by the scientific community long ago. Acidosis’ main causes usually stem from problems with breathing or the kidneys and NOT from the dietary decisions of the person. It removes skin oil and greasy dirt without harsh chemicals. It should be noted that groundwaters are usually somewhat alkaline to start with. If there are more OH  ions than H + , the water is alkaline. Pure water, which contains equal numbers of both ions, is said to be neutral. Similarly, an acidic water must always contain negative ions in addition to OH  ; the most common of these is bicarbonate HCO 3  . Each unit on the pH scale represents a hundred-fold change in the ratio of the two kinds of ions; for example, if the pH is 8, there are 100 times as many OH  ions than H + ions (that is, [H + ] = 10 –8 , [OH – ] = 10 –6 .) All water and all aqueous solutions contain both H + and OH  ions. So buying a "water ionizer" is a very expensive way of obtaining a solution that is essentially the same as diluted laundry bleach. It is the same way they can sell weight loss and male enhancement products that do not work. If you add minerals with more H than OH the pH goes down. An equal amount of H+ and OH- will give you a 7 pH. When water has more OH in it then it is alkaline. In this study, it was examined whether similar lesions would occur in mother rats which were given AKW from day zero of gestation to day 20 of lactation. I have a difficult time, however, understanding why an intelligent woman would reject scientific medicine altogether when her life was at stake. Water molecules exhibit a very slight tendency to dissociate ("ionize") into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions:  To a chemist like myself, the term is meaningless. In reality, raising the pH offers little benefit to your health. For now, I think we'll just have to leave it an open question as to why Kim Tinkham did what she did.
