So, it is erroneous to assign an exclusive deleterious or injury effect of these neuroglial responses in the CNS. Why would the government want to set up a system like this?

As always, the fact that DeLong is clearly not a scientist doesn’t necessarily mean that she is wrong (although it does increase the probability). This cell line used has gross cytogenetic abnormalities including 47 chromosomes. Miller actually cited the Geiers as though they were real researchers and not antivaccine advocates pretending to do research. Evidence of toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal insult in autism. The first mistake Miller makes is the same mistake he’s made time and time again: Dumpster diving the VAERS database. Oxidative Stress in Autism: Elevated Cerebellar 3-nitrotyrosine Levels.

They compare children who got the full 1995 schedule of vaccines vs. children who didn’t (missing one or more vaccines). Stickl, H, “Estimation of Vaccination Damage”, Med Welt, Oct 14, 1972, 23:1495-1497. Of course the vaccine uptake, by this measure, was low at the start. That brings us to point (3):  3) Here’s a trick bit: the author uses the vaccine schedule from 1995. For example, Alabama goes from 46 to 76% in two years. The vaccine uptake rate is changing dramatically during the first couple years of the study. Aaby, P., Vessari, H., Nielsen, J., Kenneth, M., et al: Sex differential effects of routine immunizations and childhood survival in rural Malawi. Children with autistic spectrum disorder  (ASD) comprise a growing caseload for EIS. They used surveys from 1997 to 2002, with children aged from 3 to 17. Yes, they chose a very artificial measure of “vaccine rate” to insure that they had big changes in the “rate” during the study period. Bonifacio, A et al, “Traffic Accidents as an expression of “Iatrogenic damage”, Minerva Med, Feb 24, 1971, 62:735-740. Let’s just say Miller and Goldstein’s rationale, methods, and analysis were rather suspect. Does this paper "demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism"? old anti-vaccine bogeymen like mercury and aluminum.

Of course, as I almost always do I’ll go farther than that, but I can’t resist pointing out a bit of misinformation right in the abstract.
