Radioactivity infiltration into the beef supply has subsided with time, and is projected to continue decreasing. This was still far above the annual level of one hundred millisievert, which should cause no harm to people. However, later reporting on 12 April estimated total caesium releases at 6,100 TBq to 12,000 TBq, respectively by NISA and NSC – about 2–4 kg. Tea leaves of one type of tea from Chiba Prefecture contained 2,720 becquerels of radioactive caesium per kilogram, 5 times above the legal safety limit. Shipments of cattle and meat would only be allowed after examination, and when the level of caesium was below the regulatory standard. In Iwate some 36,000 cattle were produced in a year. Some 1,031 beasts had been shipped that probably were fed with contaminated rice-straw. Ash from incinerators in the prefecture constituted the raw material to produce cement. Natto is normally packed in rice-straw and after the discovery of caesium contamination, they had lost many customers. On 21 October the roads around the place were sealed off, and the place was covered with sandbags three meters thick.  By August 2012, sampling of beef from affected areas revealed that 3 out of 58,460 beef samples contained radioactivity above regulatory limits. Map of contaminated areas around the plant (22 March – 3 April). Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. After the soil was removed, the radiation decreased to 0.6 microsieverts per hour at 50 centimeters above groundlevel.  On 1 August a ban was put on all cattle in the prefecture Iwate, after 6 cows from two villages were found with heavy levels of caesium. After this find Yokohama city started an investigation of soil samples collected from areas near the building. According to director William Nolten the region had a big potential for the production of clean energy.  At two locations 20 kilometers north and south and 3 kilometers from the coast, TEPCO found strontium-89 and strontium-90 in the seabed soil. It's known that increased exposure to radiation increases risk of cancer, but it's not entirely clear to what degree. This was in Ibaraki Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, in a sample of rice from the city of Hokota, about 100 miles south of the nuclear plant.  In October 2011, radiation levels as high as those in the evacuation zone around Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant were detected in a Tokyo suburb.  Air releases [ edit ]  A 12 April report prepared by NISA estimated the total release of iodine-131 was 130 PBq and caesium-137 at 6.1 PBq. Beef from Fukushima Prefecture was removed from the distribution channels. Because the origins were scattered all over the prefecture, Miyagi became the second prefecture with a ban on all beef-cattle shipments. For example alpha radiation from naturally occurring Polonium-210 is more damaging to biological tissues than gamma radiation from Cesium-137. These tests were conducted in order to verify local government data using different numbers and kinds of food samples. The seeds will be used to produce bio-diesel, which could be used to produce electricity. According to the research group, these levels were not high enough to require decontamination. The prefectural government provided the subsidies needed. This level is below the 500 mSv/year considered acceptable for emergency work by the World Health Organization. The previous record of cesium concentration in fish was 510,000 Bq/kg detected in another greenling. Scientists preparing this map, as well as earlier maps, targeted a 20 mSv/a dosage target for evacuation.  Urine samples taken from 10 children in the capital of Fukushima Prefecture were analyzed in a French laboratory. Part of this beef, which had reached the markets, still needed to be tested.  A later, 12 April 2011, NISA and NSC report estimated the total air release of iodine-131 at 130 PBq and 150 PBq, respectively – about 30 grams. For cesium-137, the highest values were in Yamagata at 150 and 1200 Bq/m2 respectively. On 23 April, NSC updated this number to 0.14 TBq per hour of caesium-137 on 5 April, but did not recalculate the entire release estimate. A number of cows were found to have consumed rice straw containing high levels of radioactive caesium. On 19 March, upland soil levels of 8,100 Bq/kg of Cs-137 and 300,000 Bq/kg of I-131 were reported. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant.
