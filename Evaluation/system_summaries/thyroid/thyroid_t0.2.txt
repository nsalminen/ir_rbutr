 Urine samples taken from 10 children in the capital of Fukushima Prefecture were analyzed in a French laboratory. Places further away were just below this maximum. On 2 July 2012 the Ministry of the Environment published that it had found radioactive cesium between 61 and 2,600 becquerels per kilogram. Those were reported to the World Health Organization in February 2013. Tellurium-129m has a half-life of 6 days, so present levels are a very small fraction of the initial contamination.  Rice [ edit ]  On 19 August radioactive caesium was found in a sample of rice. On 28 March, the erroneous radiation measurement caused TEPCO to reevaluate the software used in analysis.  On 22 September the results were published of a survey conducted by the Japanese Science Ministry. From this sample, 178 had experienced a dose of 100 millisieverts or more. At the end of October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radioactivity releases into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Based on those readings and TEPCO reports of high levels of chlorine-38, Dr. Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress speculated that transient criticalities may have occurred. However, later reporting on 12 April estimated total caesium releases at 6,100 TBq to 12,000 TBq, respectively by NISA and NSC – about 2–4 kg. HOW MUCH RADIATION WILL REACH THE WEST COAST? In September 2011, the factory was closed for two months for the same reason. He informed the city council. A total of 511,000 TBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean, 13,500 TBq of caesium-134 and 13,600 TBq of caesium-137. Map of contaminated areas around the plant (22 March – 3 April). The map displayed the concentrations found of tellurium-129m – a byproduct of uranium fission – in the soil at 14 June 2011. Some contract companies working for TEPCO have opted not to use the higher limit. At 22 sites, mainly in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, the ashes with levels under 8000 becquerels could not be buried due to the objections of concerned residents. The agency estimated an average being 5,000 TBq daily. Compare these values to the map of background radiation of Cesium-137 in the ocean before Fukushima (from 1990), it’s only 4 Bq/m3 in the Pacific.  Measurements within the reactor/turbine buildings, but not in the basement and trench areas, were made on 18 April. Over the course of the disaster, Chernobyl put out a total of 85,000 TBq of caesium-137. The melted material was not expected to breach one of the lower containers, causing a serious radioactivity release. TEPCO's chlorine-38 report was later retracted. The 5 May announcement further clarified that as of 28 April, the radioactivity level in Tokyo sewage was 16,000 Bq/kg. Life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from 65 to 58 years—not [predominantly] because of cancer, but because of depression, alcoholism and suicide. Storage at the plant was full, with 1049 drums, and some 30 tons more were still to be taken out of the incinerator. This dust was found in Japanese car filters: they contained cesium-134 and cesium-137, and cobalt at levels as high as 3 nCi total activity per sample. Their first readings were off the scale, as their Geiger-counter could measure up to 10 microsieverts per hour. A grid is laid over a map of most of eastern Japan. The second study had a wider scope, and was meant to study the geographic spread of more-radioactive isotopes, like tellurium and iodine. Officials said Tuesday that a storage tank has leaked 300 tons of radioactive water into the ground. The highest concentration found was 2.66 million becquerels per square meter, two kilometers from the plant in the empty town of Okuma. Earlier estimations were 150 PBq and 12 PBq. Instead, the melted fuel was thought to have dispersed uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of reactors No. As Japanese health and radiation specialist Shunichi Yamashita noted:  We know from Chernobyl that the psychological consequences are enormous. At 50 centimeters above the ground the reading was 1.7 microsieverts per hour. An experiment with sunflowers had no success.
