By 29 March, the number of workers reported to have been exposed to levels of over 100 mSv had increased to 19. Their first readings were off the scale, as their Geiger-counter could measure up to 10 microsieverts per hour. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. TEPCO has published estimates using a simple-sum methodology,As of 25 April 2012 TEPCO has not released a total water and air release estimate. These investigations showed on 23 October levels up to 276,000 becquerels radioactive cesium per kilogram of soil, 30 centimeters below the surface. Later measurements by the Chiba environment foundation reported a final result of 57.5 microsieverts per hour. As of 24 March 19:30 (JST), 17 workers (of which 14 were from plant operator TEPCO) had been exposed to levels of over 100 mSv. This was one of the most significant safety improvements of the early 1950s. Fukushima's basic design is one of the earliest, called a BWR (boiling water reactor). A total of 511,000 TBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean, 13,500 TBq of caesium-134 and 13,600 TBq of caesium-137.  Measurements made in Japan in a number of locations have shown the presence of radionuclides in the ground. Within 10 hours, the exposed person would develop radiation sickness, with symptoms including nausea and a drop in white blood cells. In 2011 at this place the fish measured about 50 becquerels per kilogram, and the fishing season was opened as usual. But fishing was not popular in 2011. These graphite blocks were used as the moderator. Based on the dosimeter values, exposures of 170 mSv were estimated,the injuries indicated exposure to 2000 to 6000 mSv around their ankles. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last yearalone"up from previous estimates of 360-370 PBq total. The report's estimates of total I-131 emissions based on these worldwide measuring stations ranged from 10 PBq to 700 PBq. The sheet was used to protect the school lawn against frost from 18 March until 6 April 2011. Until November this sheet was stored alongside a gymnasium. However these glitches have no influence on the authors’ main finding. In places near this storage area up to 3.95 microsieverts per hour were measured one centimeter above the ground. The second study had a wider scope, and was meant to study the geographic spread of more-radioactive isotopes, like tellurium and iodine. North-west and westwards the soil was less contaminated, because of mountain protection. East and north-east from the plant the soil was contaminated the most. Places further away were just below this maximum. Around the nuclear plant, places were found containing up to 40.000 becquerels/kg, 8 times the governmental safety limit of 5.000 becquerels/kg.  The first study concentrated on cesium-137. According to the research group, these levels were not high enough to require decontamination. Measured radioactivity per kilogram reached 250 becquerels in eastern Hokkaido, and 25 becquerels in the mountains of western Japan. Rain accumulated the cesium in the soil. According to the authors, the soil should be decontaminated, but when this is found impossible, farming should be limited. After September the city of Fukushima collected the 36,478 "glass badges" of dosimeters from all its citizens for analysis. The school planned to burn the sheet. Further inspections were requested. Samples from Chiba, Ibaraki and Tochigi also had excessive levels in celery, parsley, spinach and other leafy vegetables. On 24 March, IAEA reported that virtually all milk samples and vegetable samples taken in Fukushima and Ibaraki on 18–21 and 16–22 March respectively were above the limit. In four Prefectures (Ibaraki, Totigi, Gunma, Fukushima), distribution of spinach and kakina was restricted as well as milk from Fukushima. One day later, iodine-131 (sometimes above safe levels) and caesium-137 (always at safe levels) detection was reported in Ibaraki prefecture. One day later, the measured levels were 163,000 Bq/kg of Cs-137 and 1,170,000 Bq/kg of I-131.
