Almost all waters found in nature acquire ions such as calcium and bicarbonate as they come into contact with rocks and sediments. Several of their misleading statements are outlined below; anyone questioning my comments on them can check any standard textbook on human physiology. If there are more OH  ions than H + , the water is alkaline. Pure water, which contains equal numbers of both ions, is said to be neutral. All water and all aqueous solutions contain both H + and OH  ions. Acidic solutions have pH values of less than 7, alkaline solutions more than 7. Even the otherwise respectable Kurzweil and Grossman's Fantastic Voyage (see below) goes off the track on this craze. Hydration does indeed have benefits. The end result of all the nonsense has kept the water ionizer industry buried in the muck for years. Similarly, an acidic water must always contain negative ions in addition to OH  ; the most common of these is bicarbonate HCO 3  . If the blood pH falls outside this range the condition is known as acidosis or alkylosis. Pure water, being neutral, has a pH of exactly 7. This suggests that AKW intake causes elevation of metabolic activity. (Frasetto, 1996) Chronic mild acidosis may in fact be the underlying cause of many diseases. It’s a reasonable theory backed by  observation and case histories. Cancer can grow in an alkaline environment:  This is not true and is perfect example of a salesperson misinterpreting the scientific evidence. Water ionizers work in terms of creating health benefits. Water molecules exhibit a very slight tendency to dissociate ("ionize") into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions:  To a chemist like myself, the term is meaningless. Consuming a raw vegan diet is the best way to stay alkaline. The reasons for this are twofold:  Don't be taken in by the pseudoscience peddled by quacks, cranks, kooks or crooks! The alkaline industry seems to have blended the words alkaline and alkalinity together despite the face that they have nothing to do with each other. We get a lot of hate mail from them for even offering this article. NEVER TRUST THE SALESPERSON OR WEBSITE PITCHING THE PRODUCT. Even the purest rainwater contains some hydrogen- and bicarbonate ions that are formed when it picks up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
