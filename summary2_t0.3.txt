This means that waters whose pH differs from 7 are never "pure" in the chemical sense. Any water that is sufficiently alkaline to significantly affect gastric pH is unlikely to be considered potable by most people. (C&EN, 2011.03.14, p 40)  But if you are drinking electrolytically-produced "ionized" water, there is another plausible physiological explanation. So buying a "water ionizer" is a very expensive way of obtaining a solution that is essentially the same as diluted laundry bleach. The man who wrote the above testimonial put it on a web journal to document his progress: www.stopdoingcancer.com. If there are more OH Â– ions than H + , the water is alkaline. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution have adapted humans to tolerate drinking waters having a fairly wide range of pH (5-8). Typing "ionized water" into any Web browser will yield hundreds of hits on outfits offering to sell you this worthless quackery. It was totally in line with my belief that nature (or God) has provided us with everything we need to stay healthy and heal ourselves. Have you ever tried eating an alkaline diet, and if so, did you experience health benefits? On the surface, nothing is too outlandish. True, it is possible for water to contain dissolved ions (electrically-charged atoms or molecules), but that's something else again. At the anode, chloride ions are oxidized to elemental chlorine . They are probably even more effective for those who are inclined toward "alternative medicine" or the "wellness" industry. But would you want to drink this "eau de Clorox"? He mentioned Dr Robert Young as one of the experts in this field. The journal was started at the end of 2006 or early 2007. "* Different foods do, however, affect the pH of urine, which is confined to the bladder. Alkaline diet promoters divide foods into two types depending on the type of "ash" produced as a byproduct of eating the food. Unfortunately, none of the benefits are attributable to the water being alkaline. More recently, Tennant has been sued in Germany for misleading advertising and has been made to withdraw some of its claims in Germany, Belgium and the UK. (13, 14, 15)  So, it appears that neither physiology nor clinical trials support the acid-ash hypothesis of osteoporosis. The human body is incredibly efficient in maintaining a number of homeostatic balances and the control of the pH level is one of them. There is no scientific evidence to support the assertions about the existence of water clusters or its beneficial effects on tissue hydration.
