This violates the rule described above. Conditions may have allowed for premature dealkylation and generation of inorganic mercury species prior to injection. This occurred before the manuscript was submitted for consideration by JCN and clearly represents a conflict of interest. Report on a Fatal Case”, Bol Ofoc Sanit Panamer, Aug 1967, 63:106-110.

DeSoto & Hitlan (2007) note that Ip et al. used a two-tailed test. Of course it is possible to view this media exposure along the lines of the quip: “There is no such thing as bad publicity—just publicity”. Nu apare pe PubMed, nici pe Google Scholar.

However, the two tailed test offered by Ip et al. was more cautious.

(1) The authors, by examining cells exposed to various concentrations of ethylmercury in vitro, failed to consider issues of bioavailability in vivo. But the researchers themselves dispute this interpretation of their work. Evaluation of the Cases seen Between 1971-1977″, Monatsschr Kinderheilkd, Jan 1979, 127(1): 23-28. In other words, there’s no reason to put any real credence in this study, especially given how small the observed effect appears to be.

Two things stand out for me – aside from this pathetic litany of dishonesty of course. The “investigators” probably saw a p value of around 0.11 in the original study and realized that if they used a one-tail t-test they could cut it in half, to near 0.05.
