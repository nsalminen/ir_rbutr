Each unit on the pH scale represents a hundred-fold change in the ratio of the two kinds of ions; for example, if the pH is 8, there are 100 times as many OH  ions than H + ions (that is, [H + ] = 10 –8 , [OH – ] = 10 –6 .) Similarly, the consumption of OH ions at the positive electrode makes the water near this electrode acidic. All water and all aqueous solutions contain both H + and OH  ions. Social and judgmental biases that make inert treatments seem to work by Barry L. Beyerstein  Why Health Professionals Become Quacks by William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. APSWATER offers these articles as a public service. Biochem Biophys Res Comm 1997: 234 269-74  . Biochem Biophys Res Comm 1997: 234 269-74 K. Kikuchi et al: Hydrogen particles and supersaturation in alkaline water from an alkali-ion-water-electrolyzer. J. Electroanalytical Chem 2001: 506(1) 22-27. One wonders if these journals have reviewers qualified to give papers on this subject adequate scrutiny. It's interesting to note that the last journal in the list also published the now-discredited article on cold fusion in the 1980s. "Section 403(r)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. Sometimes you see flecks of solids and bubbles of gas appear as your body is "cleansed". Well, this is an old parlor trick, a nice chemistry-classroom demonstration, and, of course, a highly profitable scam. See here for a typical promotion. Please see here for a more complete description of detox foot baths and how they work. You hear a lot these days about alkaline or ionized water. We do not sell these or competing devices because we are honest. S. Okouchi et al: Water desirable for the human body in terms of oxidation-reduction potential (ORF) to pH relationship: J. Food Science 2002: 67(5) 1594-98. In short and based on actual science, raising the alkalinity of water doesn't do much for you. The simplest reason that you know Alkaline water is a scam is that the stomach is always acid. If the acid is low, your stomach simply pumps in more.

Alkaline water is water with a pH higher than 7.0    The pH of water is the difference between how much hydrogen (h+) water has vs. how much hydroxyl (oh-) water has.
