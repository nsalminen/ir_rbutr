# Automatic Summarization of similar articles from Rbutr

This repository contains the source code written for the NLP project for the Information Retrieval course at TU Delft.

## Running the data reader
In order to run the data reader:
1. Open your terminal
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/nsalminen/ir_rbutr.git`
3. Execute the command `cd ir_rbutr/DataReader`
4. Execute the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. If filtered.tab does not exist or need to recreate it, execute the command `python DataFilter.py`
6. If output.txt does not exist or need to recreate it, execute the command `python GraphProcess.py` **Note:** this might take while, furthermore internet connection is required

## Running the summarizer
In order to run the summarizer with the data file generated by the data reader, do the following (if you haven't yet):
1. Open your terminal
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/nsalminen/ir_rbutr.git`
3. Execute the command `cd ir_rbutr/Summarizer`
4. Verify that `output.txt` is located inside the Summarizer map. Otherwise copy it from the DataReader map
5. Execute the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Execute the command `python main.py`

## Running the evaluation
In order to run the summarizer with the data file generated by the data reader, do the following (if you haven't yet):
1. Open your terminal
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/nsalminen/ir_rbutr.git`
3. Execute the command `cd ir_rbutr/Evaluation`
4. Install https://github.com/bheinzerling/pyrouge **Note:**  Windows has a separate instruction
5. Change in `rougeMultiple.py` the parts of "absolute path to" with the absolute path to the source folder of ir_rbutr
6. Run `python rougeMultiple.py` this will run ROUGE on the summaries with threshold 0.1. The results are shown in the console and stored in the out folder. A full version of the results are available in the results folder
7. To run other thresholds rename the files `summary.001.txt` in the system_summaries folder into something else, and rename the desired threshold files to `summary.001.txt`
8. Run `python rougeMultiple.py`


*Note*: make sure to use **Python 3.6 or later**.
